    "You might recall from lecture 2 that Grover's algorithm has three main components. \n",
    "1. First, we begin by creating a superposition of all $2^n$ computational basis states by applying a Hadamard ($H$) gate on each qubit starting off in the state $\\vert0\\rangle^{\\otimes n}$. Here, the exponent $\\otimes n$ means that we have a tensor product of the states of $n$ qubits. \n",
    "2. Second, we apply an Oracle operator to mark the appropriate elements among the $2^n$ elements. The oracle operator applies a coefficient of $-1$ to each of the marked elements.\n",
    "3. Third, we apply a Diffusion operator, or diffuser, which inverts the amplitude of all elements about the average amplitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting these components together, and applying the Oracle and Diffusion operators $O(\\sqrt{N = 2^n})$ times, Grover's algorithm allows us to successfully determine the elements that were marked by the Oracle operator with high probability. This is shown in the block diagram above, where the quantum circuit for Grover's algorithm is depicted with a measurement in the end to read out the qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Graded Exercise 1: Implementing Grover's Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "As you saw in the lecture, it is not hard to implement Grover's algorithm using `Qiskit`. The goal of this lab is to implement Grover's algorithm by creating a quantum circuit that has the marked elements `000001` and `101010`. You will see that the algorithm outputs one of these two marked elements with probability greater than $99\\%$. \n",

    "Let us build each block step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.) Phase Oracle\n",
    "We start with the phase oracle. You might find it helpful to have a look at the corresponding chapter in the Qiskit textbook: https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/grover.html. However, note that the implementation in the textbook is done on 2 and 3 qubits only, while here we need to apply it to 6 qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recall that the action of the phase oracle is to add a phase of $-1$ to all states representing the marked elements, while leaving all other states unchanged.** An easy way to implement the phase oracle is to create an identity matrix on all $n$ qubits (remember that the corresponding dimension of this matrix is $2^n$) and then change those diagonal elements to $-1$ that correspond to the marked elements. Then, you need to convert that unitary into an operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have created a function below called `phase_oracle` which takes in two arguments. The first argument, $n$, gives the number of qubits in the quantum circuit. The second argument, `indices_to_mark`, is a list of the indices whose elements will be marked by the phase oracle with a phase of $-1$. Using these inputs, create a $2^n\\times2^n$ identity matrix, and apply a phase of $-1$ to the diagonal elements at locations given in `indices_to_mark`. For example, if $0$ is in `indices_to_mark`, that means you need to set the top-left-most diagonal element of the identity matrix to -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you complete these steps, apply the unitary operator to the quantum circuit."
